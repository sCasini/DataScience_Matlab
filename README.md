# Practical Data Science with MATLAB Specialization

[Coursera specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/practical-data-science-matlab?)

## About this Course

Do you find yourself in an industry or field that increasingly uses data to answer questions? Are you working with an overwhelming amount of data and need to make sense of it? Do you want to avoid becoming a full-time software developer or statistician to do meaningful tasks with your data?  

Completing this specialization will give you the skills and confidence you need to achieve practical results in Data Science quickly.  Being able to visualize, analyze, and model data are some of the most in-demand career skills from fields ranging from healthcare, to the auto industry, to tech startups.

This specialization assumes you have domain expertise in a technical field and some exposure to computational tools, such as spreadsheets.   To be successful in completing the courses, you should have some background in basic statistics (histograms, averages, standard deviation, curve fitting, interpolation).

Throughout this specialization, you will be using MATLAB.  MATLAB is the go-to choice for millions of people working in engineering and science, and provides the capabilities you need to accomplish your data science tasks.  You will be provided with free access to MATLAB for the duration of the specialization to complete your work.

## About capstone project

Like most subjects, practice makes perfect in Data Science. In the capstone project, skills learned across courses in the Practical Data Science with MATLAB specialization to explore, process, analyze, and model data will be applied.

This capstone project has been evaluated with a peer review evaluation.

## What you will find

In this repo you will find my Matlab code and a pdf print of the summary live script that permits to analyse my work even without Matlab.
Functions and data are available.

**Note**: to correclty run the script, dataset must be downloaded and directory on import code chunck must be changed.
